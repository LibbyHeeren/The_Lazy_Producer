brought us the ability to specify not just the velocity of each note in a MIDI
clip, but the probability that that note would play. This is a game changer for
the Lazy Producer. Adding variation to MIDI parts is now much easier if you
define the lower probability for “fill” notes and higher probability for notes
that you want to “anchor” in the clip.</p>

<h2>Key idea<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#key-idea-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Varying parts as they play through the song adds interest as it stops the
listener getting bored of “the same old pattern”. Too much randomness <strong><em>is</em></strong>
difficult to listen to, so balancing the unexpected with something predictable
is the sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<div id="drum-parts" class="section level3" number="3.0.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.0.1</span> Drum parts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#drum-parts"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One clear use of this is in drum parts. You can program the core drum part that
is constant throughout the clip or song, but then add passing notes, “fills”
with lower probability. Or reduce the probability on high-hat parts, shakers,
claps, lower velocity snare or kick parts so that these only sound once in a
while. With this, it’s possible to specify a clip where core elements happen
every time, but the “fills” and extra sounds only happen occasionally.
Unfortunately, it isn’t possible to specify exactly <strong><em>when</em></strong> those notes will
or won’t play, just probability. So it’s not possible to specify “Play once,
then miss for the next 3 bars” (as is possible with Elektron hardware
sequencers).</p>
<p>To see the note chance, click on the MIDI clip then click on the arrow at the
bottom of the piano-roll to show velocity. To see the chance / note probability,
click on the button below the velocity.</p>
<p>In the clip below we’ve set up a Hi-hat pattern of 16th notes. Note that each of
them has a 75% probability of playing, and I have added a little random
variation to the velocity of the hits. When we play this clip looped, the Hi-hat
pattern will be different each loop and will add a little variation and
interest.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/Probability_Drumkit_HH.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Likewise we can add some additional snare hits in the Kick and Snare clip. In
the clip below the snare hits on the 2 and 4 of the bar are always going to be
present. But the additional hits may only trigger occasionally. These also have
lower velocity which gives them the feel of “ghost notes” - barely heard, but
present. This will add a little spice and interest to the Kick and Snare parts.</p>
<p>Combined with the Hi-hat part above you get a drum part that has a decent amount
of variation without having to program a lot of different clips or parts.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/Probability_Drumkit_KickSnare.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>You can imagine employing very similar tricks in lead parts, where there is a “fixed” lead melody in the clip or loop, but additional notes that only occasionally play.</p>
<p>But the note-wise probability extends beyond drum parts.</p>
</div>
<div id="lead-parts" class="section level3" number="3.0.2">

<span class="header-section-number">3.0.2</span> Lead parts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lead-parts"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In the clip below we have a repeating pattern across the notes Bb2-G3. Notes
from Bb3-C5 have lower velocity and also lower probability. When we play this
clip, we’ll have a repeating pattern on the lower notes, but a changing pattern
on the higher notes. If you then use the velocity information to change the
timbre of the note, then this will add some light and shade into the pattern.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/NoteWiseProbability_Full_pattern.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>And extension to this technique is to separate the lower, repeating pattern and
the higher notes (with lower velocity and lower probability) into separate clips
on separate tracks:</p>
<p>Lower part on one track:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/NoteWiseProbability_Lower_notes.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Higher part on a separate track:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/NoteWiseProbability_Higher_notes.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>The advantage of splitting the parts into separate clips (and separate tracks)
is that you can shorten the length of the higher note clip - here it’s 15 1/16th
notes long. That means with each repetition, the notes appear at different
positions in the bar and so evolve against the repeating pattern. This is a key
concept in balancing predictable and unexpected, as we’ll discuss later
<a href="process-balance-unexpected-and-predictable.html#process-balance-unexpected-and-predictable">10</a>.</p>
<p>By having the notes in different tracks, you can also keep the repeating pattern
“dry” and apply delay or echo to the upper part. You could also opt to modulate
or vary the timbre and sound of either track to keep the repeating part
interesting.</p>
</div>
<div id="chord-parts" class="section level3" number="3.0.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.0.3</span> Chord parts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#chord-parts"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In <a href="recipe-changing-chords.html#recipe-changing-chords">2</a>, I have suggested using probability on chords.
If you add 8 MIDI notes in a chord and specify 50% probability for all of them,
then Ableton is going to (effectively) toss a coin for each note. In the real
world, when we toss a coin 8 times, we don’t always get 4 heads and 4 tails.
Sometimes we get 3 heads, 5 tails (or vice versa), and occasionally outcomes
like 2 heads, 6 tails. Imagine if in the coin toss, heads means that Ableton
plays the note. Then the number of notes that gets played will vary each time
the chord is played - sometimes it will be 3, sometimes 6 etc. This means that
you can specify as many notes as you like, and tune the probability until you
get something that you like the sound of, depending on whether you want more or
fewer notes in the resulting chord. It also means that careful choice of notes
from the scale within the chord allows you to sometimes get rich, complex
chords, sometimes chord inversions.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/Note-wise_probability.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>By specifying higher probability for “root notes” in the chord, you can anchor
the chord to a particular scale. As a Lazy (but creative) Producer, you can also
allow the tonality (which musical scale) is being implied to vary so that the
chords that emerge could fit with a variety of bass root notes, perhaps supplied
separately in a different track. Avoiding the third (minor / major) or seventh
of the scale can make it easier to achieve this kind of fluid and ambiguous
tonality.</p>
<p>In that same recipe, I have applied this idea across tracks as well. Using the
same MIDI chord idea across all tracks, but then changing clip lengths within
tracks (so each clip within a track has a different length) and between tracks
(so that adjacent clips in a scene have different lengths) and then coupling
this with Follow Actions as described in <a href="process-follow-actions.html#process-follow-actions">4</a> to
progress through the clips, means that the chord patterns change more subtly and
gradually than having block changes in tonality and scale. Including note-wise
probability within clips also means that the next time the clip plays you get a
slightly different result. Again, balancing something predictable - chords with
a sequence of tonality / predictable root notes - with the unpredictable -
exactly what notes are being played from the chord and that occasionally the
chords could work in both keys - means that the listener takes longer to get
bored with the sequence.</p>

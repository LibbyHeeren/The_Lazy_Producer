# Recipe - Changing chords

1.  Start with three MIDI tracks.

2.  Make three clips in each track.

3.  Prepare stacked chords (8 notes or so) from A minor, D minor, G minor in each clip within the tracks, avoiding notes that are specific to each scale in the clip. Use Scales in Ableton to help. The scales suggested are arbitrary, but the recipe will work best if you use scales that are "next door" to each other in the cycle of 5ths - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths>). You can use notes of any length, but since we will be using probability (step 4 below) on individual notes, I recommend notes of 1 bar length. The longer the note, the longer the held chord.

4.  Use random note probability (a new feature in Live 11) on all notes in the chord, set at about 50-60% probability so that each time the clip triggers, the note choice / chord is different. This will mean that sometimes the chord will have 4 notes, but it could vary between 2 and 7... (in fact it could vary between none and 8, but the the extremes are very unlikely).

5.  Make sure that the clip lengths vary between tracks (all notes within the clip have the same length). So clip1 in track 1 could have 16 bar loops; clip 1 in track 2 could have 15 bar loops; clip 1 in track 3 could have 14 bar loops etc. The important thing is not the clip length, but the fact that they vary ***across*** tracks.

6.  ALSO, vary clip lengths between scenes ***within*** tracks. So a track that has 16 in clip 1, maybe has 15 bar loop in clip 2 and 14 bar loop in clip 3. Similarly, the exact length is unimportant. The important thing is that the clip lengths vary both within tracks and between tracks. AVOID having the same clip lengths in the same scenes.

7.  Set up Follow Actions (see following chapter) to progress to Next clip at end of each clip with 100% probability.

8.  Choose sounds for each track that complement each other. Could be pads, arpeggios, textures etc. Arpeggios and sounds that evolve are particularly useful in this recipe. You can automate parameters within clips as well to introduce additional movement in the sound. An important point is that the sound shouldn't be too static.

9.  Press play. Sit back and relax.

(I say "one instance" because this is generative and uses probability. So the next time I render the track it could well sound different. Similar, but different.)

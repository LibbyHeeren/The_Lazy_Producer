# Recipe - Audio clip or Sampler into effects



The Sampler instrument from Ableton Live is often used to slice and dice breaks and loops, or to produce multi-sampled instruments that allow you to recreate sounds and playback across the keyboard. But in our context we're going to use it to simply play back a longer textured sound sample and apply some modulation to the cutoff, producing a drone sound. We can then throw this through a barrage of effects - either using Return channels or via individual audio effects with the sampler output routed into each. Effectively we're reusing an idea we've used before, but starting with Sampler as the audio generator. You could alternatively use the audio output from PaulStretch as the drone generator. The benefit of using Sampler is that we can add MIDI effects to (randomly) change the pitch of the sample so that it doesn't have to be consistent from one loop to another. Other sample-based instruments like Granulator will allow you to do similar.

# Tools - PaulXStretch



PaulXStretch (https://sonosaurus.com/paulxstretch/) is a plugin that takes an audio file and stretches it to produce soundscapes and textures. This is not the type of stretching that is available in Ableton for warping audio by a few bpm to fit a different tempo, but instead is about sonic manipulation even to extreme amounts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key idea {.unnumbered}

Taking an audio clip that has interesting harmonic structure, chords, textures and stretching it out using PaulXStretch can give you instant ambient textures and drones. Even using short audio clips and stretching out 5x or 10x can give interesting textures to work from.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What does it do?

PaulXStretch takes an audio file and can stretch it to a pretty arbitrary amount (maximum is over 1000x). This allows you to take very short audio clips as input and stretch them out to create soundscapes of pretty much any size. So if you take the 5 second Windows Startup sound, you can stretch this 60x to create a five minute soundscape. 

Some audio stretching algorithms, such as those used by default in Ableton to stretch audio, introduce artefacts and granulations once the algorithm goes beyond a modest decrease in beats per minute (bpm). But PaulXStretch also applies some (spectral) smoothing to create textures that are free of glitches - the sound is smeared evenly in the sonic palette. 

The plugin also features various options to tweak the output of the stretched audio, including filters, the ability enhance resonant frequencies, pitch shift and more. 

## How do I use it?

You *can* use PaulXStretch as a plugin, but you can also use it as a standalone application. This would allow you to import, stretch, and then export the stretched file ready to import into your DAW as standalone audio. The latter is probably preferable in many cases - audition the file and stretching in the context of your tune, then commit and export to file.

## What should I use it for?

This is a plugin that favours some experimentation. You could take a short, textural clip that you like and then stretch this out to see how the textures react to extreme stretching. Note that if the input clip features some prominent harmonics or frequencies, these will be accentuated when the audio is stretched, so you may want to EQ the input clip ***first*** before applying stretch to eliminate any howling frequencies. 
I have had some success using short clips with interesting chord patterns, and then stretching this out to create a long-form piece. Because chord changes are preserved, but smeared and smoothed, the track then shifts in tonality, rather than being a long drone on a single tone.

But you could also take really short snippets of (atonal) sound and stretch these to add textural ambience to other pieces. Bird noises, doors slamming, rocks crashing or the sound of rain or water drops could make very interesting textures if stretched 10x or 100x.

As an experiment I once took the grindcore metal band Napalm Death's (in)famous "You Suffer" track, all 1.316 seconds of it (Guiness World Record holder for the shortest song), and stretched it out to 3 minutes. The result was TERRIFYING.

However, other artists have taken sounds like the Windows Startup sounds and stretched these to make a little more pleasing textures: https://soundcloud.com/ideoforms/sets/windows-startup-sounds-slowed-4000

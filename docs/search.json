From a performance perspective, once set up, you can press play and let it do its thing. But what if you want to commit the state of the system to share with others. That involves capturing the generated MIDI, modulations and generated audio. This chapter will discuss how you might go about capturing the processes so that you can later release the track.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Key idea {.unnumbered}\n\nI find it useful to separate MIDI tracks that *generate* or *transform* MIDI information from instrument tracks that receive that MIDI information and generate sound. The idea is to capture the generated and transformed MIDI for later processing. It can then be copied into the instrument track and \"bounced down\" or rendered with the instrument track to capture the sound. In this process don't worry about having more tracks than you think necessary. This will give more flexibility and options in the capturing process. There is quite a large difference between Live sets for performance and Live sets for capturing and committing the performance for release.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## In the beginning\n\nWhen you first start creating Live sets for generative music, the important thing is to have fun with the process. So throw MIDI devices into chains, see what happens, refine and reapply. Route MIDI from one place to another, add more MIDI transformations. Go wild. Play. Inevitably though, at some point, you're going to want to apply a little order to the chaos. And in fact, even in the creation process taking a little time to plan ahead can open up some new avenues for generating, transforming and routing.\n\n## MIDI Generators\n\nI like to have separate tracks for MIDI generators. These are the \"starting point\" of a process. They will be generating MIDI notes through random processes, patterns or Follow Actions. I like to keep the generators separate from the transformation MIDI tracks, because you may want to send the ***same*** generated MIDI notes into several transformation chains. This will lead to a more coherent result since different transformation chains ingest a consistent set of generated MIDI input notes.\n\n## MIDI Transformer tracks\n\nThese tracks will take the MIDI generator process outputs and apply MIDI effects and transformations to add additional MIDI notes, information, modulation etc. You could have a virtual instrument / sound generator plugin in this track. If you do that, then you can route the MIDI from this track ***AFTER*** (MIDI) FX into another track for further transformation, MIDI effects or to another instrument.\n\n## Capturing the MIDI\n\nTo capture the random processes from the generation and transformation steps, you should create new MIDI tracks that \"listen\" to the output of the generation and transformation tracks. In my Live sets I typically have a lot of tracks where the Monitor is set to \"In\" or \"listening\" mode. That passes the incoming audio from another track straight through to the effects or instruments on that track. Having separate \"capturing\" MIDI tracks allows you to pick up the generated and/or transformed MIDI when you record. This is a good thing to be able to \"tidy up\" or \"garden\" the generated MIDI information on the road to release.\n\nIf you record only into tracks where there is MIDI effects and instruments then the transformed MIDI is never captured - only the ***generated*** MIDI. This may not be a problem *per se* but when you render out the final audio, you are at the mercy of Live's internal random processes and you'll be crossing your fingers that either the result is ***the same*** as you heard previously (if Live replays the randomness in the same way each time) or potentially different (perhaps if you reopen the set in a later version of Live).\n\nIf you capture the (generated ***and*** transformed MIDI) in a separate track, then you can use this track as the input for tracks with virtual instruments / plugins in them. Where these tracks might have had MIDI Monitor set to \"In\" you can now switch that back to \"Auto\" so that the captured MIDI is used directly as the input for that instrument.\n\nOnce you have captured the generated and transformed MIDI it's safe to switch off the generators and MIDI effects in those tracks. This will ensure that it's only the captured MIDI that is being used to drive the virtual instruments and plugins.\n\n## Modulation on track volume - use the Utility device to modulate GAIN\n\nIf you have gone completely down the rabbit hole of random modulation of your track volumes, it may have been tempting to modulate the Mixer Volume so that tracks fade in and out in a random way. But let me caution ***against*** doing this. This technique is fine for performance, but when it comes to capturing and committing a generative track, the better solution is to modulate the Gain of a Utility plugin. Modulating gain allows you to separately alter the Volume slider on the mixer to change the ***overall*** level of a track ***relative*** to the others. This is a good tip for audio production generally - automate your track Gain, not your Mixer Volume.\n\n## Group tracks to tidy your Live set\n\nWith all of these tracks floating about it can be tricky to keep track of what track does what in your Live set. Live's ability to group tracks is a really useful feature. It's ***your*** choice how you group them... You can group MIDI generation and transformation tracks - the individual tracks will still send MIDI output to wherever they are routed - as this allows you to \"fold away\" the generation and transformation processes when it comes to capturing and committing for release (assuming you have captured the MIDI as described above and copied it into the tracks with virtual instruments / plugins).\n\n<!--chapter:end:011-Process-Workflow-Capturing_Ideas.Rmd-->\n\n---\n---\n---\n\n# Tools - MIDI Generators\n\nThe MIDI tools discussed in the previous chapter are useful to transform, augment and add notes to existing MIDI sequences, but we also need to generate those sequences in the first place. Ableton Live Suite and Max for Live plugins offer a few options to generate sequences of notes.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Key idea {.unnumbered}\n\nYou can play or program in sequences to be used as the basis for generative ambient music, and we did exactly this for [Recipe - Changing Chords]. But to create melodic or note sequences you may also wish to use a MIDI note generator like those discussed below. All of these devices will create MIDI note sequences - all of them can use random probability to generate note sequences that constantly change or evolve. As we have discussed in the section [Process - Balancing the unexpected with the predictable] too much randomness can be difficult for the listener to engage with. Fortunately, most of these plugins allow you to tailor the amount of randomness or to slowly evolve.\n\nIf you ever thought that DAW sequencers were too limited compared to modular synthesiser setups, I challenge you to review the tools below (and others available via Max for Live) and find holes in functionality. (But don't email me to argue, find them and let me know. Submit an Issue to tell me that there's a different sequencer that I haven't talked about!)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Ableton Live 11 Suite, there are many plugins that will generate note sequences and allow you to specify per note probability. Many of these were developed before Live 11 introduced per note probability in the MIDI piano roll.\n\n## Melodic Steps\n\nMelodic steps (Max for Live sequencer provided with Ableton Live 11 Suite) is a sequencer that disentangles note pitch, octave, length, velocity and probability. This allows you to sequence these attributes separately. You can define the length of each sequence separately, so you can have all sequences with the same length for predictable MIDI sequences, or change the length of one or more to produce more elaborate patterns. Having sequences that are even numbers of steps will bring you back to repetition faster than having sequences that are prime sequences (remember common factors from your elementary arithmetic lessons?). Note that each lane has the option to \"roll the dice\" and add randomness, either a little (score 2 dice) or a lot (score 5 dice). Also, note that the \"Playback\" setting can choose to play back at twice the speed or half the speed.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"images/Melodic_Steps.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Bouncy Notes\n\nBouncy Notes is a device provided in the \"Inspired by Nature\" pack developed by Dillon Bastan. This device gives you the ball-drop bouncy repeats triggered by incoming MIDI notes, or with a little tweaking you can get it to automatically produce balls which trigger MIDI notes on a scale, quickly or slowly, resulting in nice echoes and cascades of notes. The balls bounce on the keyboard along the bottom triggering MIDI notes. You can choose whether the balls bounce back up to trigger notes again (\"Bounce\" settings) and whether the balls bounce off the \"walls\". Both of these will keep the balls in motion for longer. Tweaking ball speed, gravity and mass will affect how quickly (or slowly) the balls move around inside the box (\"Speed\" setting). Higher \"Gravity\" settings will mean that balls drop towards the MIDI notes more quickly. If you recall physics lessons from school, then you may remember that \"Gravity\" AND \"Mass\" affect how quickly notes fall (unless they are in a vacuum). So balls with larger mass fall more quickly under the same gravity. You can affect these via input velocity using \"Vel\\>Grav\", \"Vel\\>Mass\" (and in fact \"Vel\\>Hght\" and \"Vel\\>Ball\"). All together this sets up some physical (pun intended) rules by which the balls move in the space and how they interact with the walls and \"floor\" which triggers the MIDI notes.\n\nIn the screenshot below I have specified that all generated notes should be quantised to D minor pentatonic. I have also chosen for notes to be generated automatically every bar (Drop setting to Auto and \"1b\") and last for at most 4 bars (\"Lifetime\"). At any one time we'll have at most 6 balls in play (\"Voices\"). I have also set the note \"Quantize\" to be eighth notes = 8n. This ensures that the note triggers will not clash with anything else going on in the sequencer that is rhythmic or on the beat. But tuning the \"Speed\" setting you can tailor the density of notes generated. Adding randomness on direction that the balls are travelling when they are generated \"Rnd\\>Dir\" you can generate additional notes in the scale as the balls bounce off the sides and hit the \"notes\" on the bottom.\n\n<img src=\"images/Bouncy_notes.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Dr Chaos\n\n\"Dr Chaos\" is part of the [Probability Pack by Sonic Faction](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/probability-pack/). This plugin allows you specify a sequence of notes across 8 steps. Notes can be quantised to notes in a scale using the drop down \"Scale\" setting on the far right at the bottom. The Network panel on the left dictates the order of notes. In this example, Note 1 \"C\" will be followed by Note 3 \"F\". Note 2 \"D#\" will also be followed by Note 3 \"F\". This sequence as defined means that when press \"Play\" and start the transport in Ableton then the \"D#\" note won't necessarily play (since we start at Note 1 \"C\"). BUT in this case we have a little \"Chaos\" dialled in to the notes, which adds a little randomness, which might occasionally play the \"D#\". Like the \"Melodic Steps\" sequencer above, Dr Chaos also allows you to define potential Octave, Velocity and Length of each note ***and*** add randomness to that through the \"Chaos\" slider. This adds some extra \"spice\" to the sequence. We can also specify the \"Rate\" of the sequence, so you can generate faster or slower sequences.\n\nDr Chaos can store a number of patterns for both the note network (left) and the note attributes (right) so it's possible to set up sequences that you want to use and play through these, or jump to specific combinations.\n\nI like Dr Chaos because you can set up networks of notes that will give potentially nice sounding sequences, but randomness can kick in to take you somewhere else instead. It breaks you out of the typical sequencer where the sequence of notes is predictable, even if probability is intervening to stop some notes from happening every time.\n\n<img src=\"images/Dr_Chaos.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Euclidean Sequencer Pro\n\nEuclidean sequencers are commonly found in modular rigs, where can produce interesting polyrhythms for melodic instruments and also interesting rhythmic sequences for drum sounds. This [Max for Live Euclidean Sequencer](https://maxforlive.com/library/device/7608/euclidean-sequencer-pro) is an implementation of that for Ableton Live. Euclidean sequencers work by defining the number of steps in one rotation of a circle, then allocating a number of events as evenly as possible around the steps in that circle. All sequences start at the twelve o'clock position unless you specify a \"Rotation\" amount to offset the starting point. You can also specify a \"Speed\" setting for each of the four sequences, nominate a note that corresponds to each sequence (especially useful when used in conjunction with a drum rack). Particularly useful for generating sequences that are rhythmically interesting.\n\nI have used the Euclidean Sequencer Pro with non-rhythmic ideas as well. Choose four notes e.g. C3, D4, G3 and A#3/ Bb3. Setting a pattern with more sparse settings for D4 and A#3 can give some interesting patterns and chords. I combined this with the Random and Scales plugins described earlier to add some variation to the generated notes.\n\n<img src=\"images/Euclidean_sequencer_pro.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Less Concepts\n\nLess Concepts is a sequencer. How it works is complicated. That it works is down to maths, permutations and combinations of cell values and adjacent cell contents.\n\n> *less concepts is rooted in the idea that complexity is just a shit-ton of simplicity, chained together. at its core, less concepts holds 65,536 possible combinations of notes which can be gated, offset, and manipulated to create minimal sequences for improvisation. small changes to a single parameter can bring sweeping or subtle changes.*\n>\n> *seek. think. discover. - Linus Schrab*\n\nSuffice to say that it generates sequences or bursts of MIDI notes that can be used in generative ambient music. That it's available as a free Max for Live device is down to the generosity and genius of [the musician](https://dndrks.bandcamp.com) and [developer Dan Derks.](https://github.com/dndrks)\n\nLess Concepts produces MIDI sequences rather are less random and slightly more melodic. The key items to focus on here are the \"Rule\" setting, which in the screenshot below is 30, and the \"Seed\" setting which is 46. Different rules provide different rhythmic / melodic results and the \"Seed\" setting results in slightly different variations of that rule. For a given Rule and Seed you will always get predictable results, so if you use Less Concepts and fix the starting Rule and Seed you can always guarantee the same result. But one trick I've played with is to use a random LFO to vary the seed every 4 bars (or more) to balance unexpected and predictable, as we've discussed before.\n\nThe \"low\" and \"high\" settings define the range of notes that will be used in the sequence.\n\nLess Concepts is definitely a sequencer that invites exploration, trial and error. Sometimes the results are surprising, other times they fade away and you're left in silence. If you need further explanation of what's happening under the hood, I suggest you explore the notes that Dan Derks provides.\n\n<img src=\"images/Less_concepts.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Turing machines\n\n***How*** Turing machines work for pattern generation involves things called Shift Registers and moving zeros or ones down a line. Sound & Voltage has an excellent description here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va2XAdFtmeU> if you want to dig into that and understand better. But it's ***what*** they do that is of interest to the Lazy Producer. It's a device that spits out random sequences of notes, until you move a dial and \"lock in\" a pattern. Move the dial a little way back towards the random (middle position) and the device will repeat the locked in sequence, but add occasional new notes. What's of interest then to the Lazy Producer is the ability to move gradually from random to repeating, predictable sequence and anywhere in between allowing us to balance the unexpected with the predictable.\n\nIn the image below the key part is the left hand end of the Turing Machine. If the dial is set to \"Random\" then we get a random sequence of notes in the given range (here between A2 and A5) based on the specified clock setting - in this case 8th notes. If we turn the dial completely to the right to \"Lock\" then we will lock in a repeating sequence of given length - here 8 notes. As we move the dial gradually back to the \"Random\" setting then we introduce a chance of random changes to the pattern, with the chance of randomness depending how close we are to the \"Random\" setting. What this means in practice is that we can Lock a sequence, gradually turn the dial back to allow changes to that sequence, then Lock again to \"capture\" that change. If we turn the dial all the way to the left then we also Lock the sequence, but the repeating sequence will be twice as long i.e. it will take twice as long to come back to the start of the sequence. Because what is generated is a random sequence, we might want to apply a Scale plugin to this to quantise the note outputs and conform them to a particular scale.\n\nThe Max for Live device shown below includes additional features to map output \"voltage\" signals (modulation) from the Turing Machine to devices in Live, and to use the Gate information from the Turing machine to trigger devices like drum machines. These extensions to functionality are still driven by the same essential random processes and \"locking in\" sequences discussed above.\n\n<img src=\"images/Turing_Machine.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## MIDI Waves\n\n[MIDI Waves](https://isotonikstudios.com/product/midi-waves-by-ned-rush/) is a paid Max for Live plugin from Isotonik and [Ned Rush](https://www.youtube.com/@NedRush). It is a very useful MIDI sequencer based on the principle of quantising base LFO waveforms through sample and hold. The base LFO waveform (in the screenshot below it's a Triangle wave) runs at a specified rate, either Hz or Synced to Ableton's clock. Pitch values here are sample at a separate rate (here 16th notes) to generate ascending and descending note pitches. The rate of sample and the rate of the base LFO dictate how closely the generated pitches follow the base LFO but can sometimes result in sequences that follow arpeggio like patterns, but not quite (due to slight differences between the base LFO and the sample rate). Note that a second LFO is available to add into the base LFO as a frequency modulation (FM) and you can choose the frequency, shape and amount to be added to the base LFO. This can add more random variability in the pitch sequence generated. Note that the FM LFO is added ***before*** the blue \"sampling\" process. So the Sine LFO here is adding a little positive and negative to the base triangle LFO before sampling, resulting in pitch sequences that change subtly each time. Similar processes can be used to generate Velocity, Duration and Gate information. Gate in particular allows you to define the rate at which notes are generated, independent of their pitch. What can result is slight changes in the rhythms of the generated notes, right up to their being clusters of notes, rather than a steady stream.\n\nThis technique is sometimes employed in modular synths if a more traditional sequencer is not being used, as all you need to drive it is a base LFO and a \"sample and hold\" random generator.\n\n<img src=\"images/MIDI_waves.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Midivolve\n\nThe [Ableton Max for Live pack and device with Coldcut - Midivolve](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/midivolve/) Pack is a paid plugin for Ableton Suite. It works by randomly adding variation to MIDI clip in the track where the plugin is placed. That variation can act on MIDI notes, velocity, duration, density (how many notes are playing) as well as being able to map two different parameters in Live. The \"A\" column defines which parameters experience variation on the next \"Evolve!\" trigger (in the screenshot below this is set to automatically evolve all parameters once the clip has played through 3 times). If the \"I\" column is checked then the last evolution acts as the basis for the next variation change. Note that variation amount can be specified via \"Ammt\" and this is separate to \"Chance\" of the variation happening. Chance is the probability of the value being varied / evolved ***for each note / step.*** This opens up a large number of possibilities to vary input sequences but to balance the unexpected evolution with a repeat of the evolved pattern before the next change is made i.e. let the listener get used to each chance - being predictable, if only for a finite period. Variation can be constrained through the Scale settings.\n\n<img src=\"images/Midivolve.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## SEEDS - Polymath and friends\n\n[Seeds from Novel Music](https://www.novelmusic.org/m4l/seeds) is actually a collection of sequencing plugins that offer modular synthesiser style control over clocks, note sequences, scales, and much more. This is a paid pack of Max for Live devices, but if you are interested in a collection of tools for modular style sequencing with Ableton Live there is a HUGE amount of potential in this pack. In fact, I can't do justice to the full set of features available, and I can only recommend that interested users look into the [tutorial videos prepared by Novel Music to describe their functionality](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjyWHWk9AS6MMpgD88K4U6TICgEjjClFR).\n\nIn the screenshot below I'm using the \"Sweet 16\" clock module from SEEDS which provides four different clocks which can be used by Polymath. Each clock proceeds at a different pace, all driven by Ableton Live's master clock i.e. Ableton provides the \"1/16th\" pulse that drives the clocks. Each clock is allocated a label - here \"W\", \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\". This helps to identify the clock drivers in other devices.\n\nPolymath is a four track sequencer. Each track specifies notes, octaves, velocity, duration, strum, ratchet, bend (pitch bend) and mod. The sequence length is set for the track. If you look to the right the \"Deviate\" setting allows you to add some random probability to each element of the sequence. In fact, Novel Music provides a free device \"Deviate\" that provides JUST this functionality if that's all you need.\n\nPolymath has a neat trick up its sleeve. It allows you to set scales for each track (and in fact across ALL tracks) and you can set two different scales then use a slider to begin to introduce notes from Scale 2 in the sequence even though the majority are from Scale 1. When the slider is all the way to the right, then Scale 2 is 100% in effect. Similarly on the right-hand side, a slider allows you to introduce random variation but then \"LOCK\" that variation if you stumble onto something you like.\n\nThe \"Expand\" setting adds additional notes to the sequence, always honouring the Scale set for the sequence. This can be dialed up and back so it's possible to add additional notes and then go back to the original sequence.\n\nEach track can run to a different clock, so it's possible to set up four different sequences that proceed at different rates. Very handy for generative music. Also, the sequences can run forward, back, forward-then-back, and randomly. So somewhere in there you should be able to find a sweet spot to generate some new ideas.\n\nThe SEEDS pack also includes very useful plugins that can send output to and from various devices and clocks. The \"Hub\" plugin receives and sends MIDI information from one track to another. So it's possible to have generative plugins on one track which send MIDI information to a completely different track, which can then be processed independently.\n\n<img src=\"images/Polymath.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Others I haven't mentioned\n\nTom Glendinning / ELPHNT is keeping a curated list of Max for Live plugins he uses in his music which includes some excellent sequencers. If I haven't touched on your favourite Max for Live sequencer here, you should [check out Tom's list](https://elphnt.io/max-for-live-curated/) and review what he's presenting.\n\nFor example the MDD\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_SNAKE device is based on the Make Noise Renee modular sequencer. Tom has provided a [very helpful introduction here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2_mdrz9XrU).\n\n<!--chapter:end:012-Tools-MIDI_Generators.Rmd-->\n\n# Recipe - Using MIDI generators \n\nIn this recipe we're going to use a MIDI generator tool - Euclidean Sequencer Pro - to generate the initial MIDI information which is then fed into additional tracks using techniques discussed in Recipe 2 - MIDI Tools and Routing.\n\n    \n    \n1.  Place the Euclidean Sequencer Pro generator in a track. Euclidean Sequencer Pro is a Max for Live device which can be used to generate polyrhythmic sequences of notes, and is typically used for rhythmic patterns and because of this, by default it only generates 4 note values. Because we're going to use it here for more melodic output, we're going to add Random and Scale MIDI devices so that we generate a wider range of notes.\n\nFeel free to set up the Euclidean Sequencer Pro device to generate a variety of pulse Events across a variety of Step values for each note. It's nice to mix up odd and even Events, Steps and Speeds across the 4 generators. This ensures that we don't just get a repeating pattern, although it might also be interesting to explore a combination of predictable and more unexpected patterns (balancing the unexpected and predictable!). We can also use modulators to shift the Rotation / offset of the sequences to add additional unexpectedness if that's helpful.\n\n<img src=\"images/Recipe4_EuclideanSequencerPro.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n2. We're now going to use many of the techniques previously seen in Recipe 2 - MIDI Tools and Routing, where we take the output from the Euclidean sequencer and then route it to a number of different synth engines while also applying some additional MIDI tool processing.\n\n<img src=\"images/Recipe4_Routing.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nFirst, let's take the \"raw\" output from the Euclidean Sequencer and route it into a MIDI instrument track using a plucky Operator sound - could be a simple sine wave with no sustain and fairly quick decay.\n\n<img src=\"images/Recipe4_Operator.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n3. Create another MIDI instrument track where we're going to take the same Euclidean Sequencer Pro MIDI information, but now use the MIDI Note Echo device to delay the input by an amount (I'm using 16 16ths = 1 bar). The key thing is to MUTE the original MIDI information. Also add a Note Length MIDI device to turn the incoming MIDI notes into chords. We can then use these delayed and \"smeared\" MIDI chords with a pad sound. I'm using Wavetable, but you can choose a pad sound from any virtual instrument.\n\n<img src=\"images/Recipe4_Pad.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n4. Create another MIDI instrument track and use the MIDI from the chord \"pad\" track we've just created as the input. Be sure to set the input to \"Post FX\" so that it will apply the MIDI device effects to transform the MIDI ***before*** routing it into the new track. In this track, we'll add an Arpeggiator MIDI device. We can use a bell like tone for this track. I'm going to use Operator again, with some modulation applied to the second modulating oscillator (which will then vary the tone of the main Sine wave carrier oscillator). I'm also going to apply modulation to the rate of the Arpeggiator device. You can try out various settings here, including using an unsynced or \"Free\" running Arpeggiator rate. You may need to tailor the amount or range of modulation to get Arpeggiator rates that don't swing too far between VERY quick and VERY slow.\n\n<img src=\"images/Recipe4_Arp.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n5. Feel free to continue adding additional tracks to bring texture and a variety of tones to your track. I've included a \"choir\" and textured pad tracks. Experiment with where these take the incoming MIDI information from, and how you can manipulate the MIDI further using a variety of MIDI transformation devices.\n\n6. You could also experiment with other MIDI generators discussed in Chapter 13, such as Bouncy Notes, Turing Machine, Less Concepts, etc. The MIDI generating tools provide the raw stream of MIDI notes, but the effects here are used to provide the texture around that sequence.\n\n7.  Press play. Sit back and relax.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can hear my version of this track here: <https://soundcloud.com/mikeksmith/euclidean-nonrhythm/s-dhj7xJVXSJU>\n\n\n\n\n<!--chapter:end:013-Recipe-MIDI_generators.Rmd-->\n\n---\n---\n---\n\n# Tools - Audio Generators\n\n\n\nCreate something from nothing with these audio generators. These aren't so much \"instruments\" - they do not need MIDI input to drive them, and will make noise as soon as you press \"Play\" on the Ableton transport. That's both a good thing and a bad thing - you may want to start a set with the faders down! These devices can be used to power a drone set very effectively though - just route them through additional effects and/or resonators to create some rich tones.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Key idea {.unnumbered}\n\nMIDI generators (as discussed in [Tools - MIDI Generators] produce MIDI notes which can be further processed via the MIDI plugins that we explored in [Tools - Chords and added notes] and then played through instruments. But Ableton Live also has some sound generators that will produce sounds without the need of MIDI input or in fact ***any*** input. We just need to think a little creatively and use a generous number of Audio plugins to process the sound into the shape we would like. These sound generators are more likely to produce drones and textures than melodies, so may augment some of the tools previously discussed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Pinging resonantors / resonant filters\n\nThere's a technique in synthesis where you \"ping\" a resonant filter with a click or burst of noise which provides the \"exciter\" to generate a tone. This is relatively simple to achieve in Ableton Live using stock effects in Live Suite. We use a burst of noise from the \"Vinyl Distortion\" plugin which emulates the crackles and noise from a vinyl record, gate this to only allow the crackles to come through. The \"Erosion\" plugin accentuates the noise around this crackle and the \"Auto Filter\" specifies a frequency band that will pass through to the later resonators and effects.\n\n<img src=\"./images/Pinging_Filters.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nHainbach has a great video explaining the technique here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJRXxkswXdg>\n\nIn our case, instead of using feedback with filters, we can exploit Ableton Live's own resonator plugins: \"Resonator\", \"Spectral Resonator\" and \"Corpus\". In the image below we're using the \"Spectral Resonator\" to generate some pitched tones. We're feeding it notes from an external MIDI clip which uses the same note probability techniques explained previously. This then feeds into the \"Resonators\" plugin which provides additional pitched resonance, and the \"Spectral Time\" plugin which smears out this pitched resonance so that it's not a short burst of pitched information.\n\n<img src=\"./images/Resonators.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Tree Tone\n\nFrom the Inspired by Nature pack by Dillon Bastan this is primarily a resonant drone generator but with some additional bells and whistles. Literally. The \"Tree\" in the central panel has \"branches\" that define resonators / resonant frequencies. Thicker, longer branches have lower pitch and louder volume. Thinner branches have higher pitch but lower volume. In the image below the \"Tree\" has fewer large branches and so would be expected to have some lower drone sounds. The position of the branches to left or right is their position in panning. The \"Noise\" amount and filtering determines how much these resonators are excited by the noise. The \"Wind\" provides additional movement and modulation to the system - affecting volume and filtering. The \"Rain\" setting \"pings\" the resonators as with a \"raindrop\" (or mallet). More \"Rain\" and \"Speed\" will ping the resonators providing chimes. The \"Algo/Mix\" setting will affect the overall pitch of the system - lower values being warmer or darker, higher values brighter. Tuning the system will ensure that frequencies and \"pings\" from raindrops conform to a scale. \"Inharmnic\" will add some inharmonic frequencies or more \"clangerous\" sounds.\n\nThis is a deceptively useful generator, as it can be used to create beautiful drones, or you can switch off \"Noise\" and have just the \"raindrops\". Combining this with some additional resonators or effects can create an evolving, generative ambience just on its own.\n\nTwo Easter Eggs to Tree Tone exist: The top \"microphone\" button on the far right allows you to route ANY audio signal through Tree Tone and excite the resonators. So Tree Tone can be used as either as a generator OR an effect (similar to the Corpus device). Below this is the \"Sine\" button which opens modulation dialogue where you can device two LFOs and two envelopes and then route these to parameters of the device. So you don't need to stick with a static sound, and the envelopes can be triggered by incoming MIDI information.\n\n<img src=\"./images/Tree_tone.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Harmonic Drone Generator\n\nDoes exactly what is says on the tin. This is a drone generator from the Drone Lab pack in Ableton Suite. You can set the root tone, and then the resonant frequencies of other resonators. When the button is lit orange above the resonator it will be heard. Below the resonator you can choose to add or decrease the resonant pitch (up to 10Hz either above or below). Note that resonant pitch tuning can be set to \"Just\" intonation or \"Equal temperament\". \"Just\" pitch divisions result in more harmonious noises, but don't necessarily correspond to tone pitches. So while \"Just\" will give you better sounding drones, don't be surprised if it sounds \"off\" compared to pitched notes from other sources...\n\nAgain, this is a nice generator to use as the fundamental source for a textured drone session. You can feed the output of this device through other effects to manipulate, distort, and augment sounds from it. You can also \"play\" the device using MIDI input. The \"Glide\" option gives a nice glide effect as the resonators re-pitch to the new incoming note.\n\n<img src=\"./images/Harmonic_Drone_Generator.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Cellular Degradation\n\nThis is a [paid plugin by Dillon Bastan](https://dillonbastan.gumroad.com/l/yyehc?layout=profile) which features six tone generating synthesis engines with a generator mechanism based on cellular growth and decay. If you're familiar with Conway's \"Game of Life\" then this concept might be familiar, but basically cells are generated and rules govern whether that cell will continue to survive or decay depending on the state of neighbouring cells. So if a new cell has surrounding cells which are alive, it will \"survive\", but if there aren't sufficient live cells neighbouring then it will decay. The \"Born\" rule will spawn new cells adjacent to the clicked cell\n\nThe six tone generators work in L+R pairs, so there are actually 12 sets of parameters that can be affected by the cell values if the \"Voices\" is set to 6. Different parameters of the tone generators are shown to the right of the square display and by clicking on the row for each parameter, it will set the value for that parameter using the \"Value\" scaling to the bottom left of the square display. This then scales the range of possible values for each parameter which shows the offset / lowest value (left % number) and the range (right % number).\n\nI thoroughly recommend reviewing [Misty Jones' YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM2ksxavJzI) on this plugin. She has comprehensively explored and described the various options and settings.\n\nSo what this gives us is a way of generating tones. You can quantize changes to Hz or rhythmic pulses. In the screenshot below, I'm modulating the \"Draw XY\" left and right boxes and the \"Value\" box through the Strange Mod modulator (also by Dillon Bastan). This means that the Strange Mod modulation device is essentially drawing values into the square display. Outside the captured image, I'm also using another instance of Strange Mod to set values for some of the parameters.\n\nThe sound the generator creates is a little odd, but through use of additional audio effects it's possible to create some interesting evolving drone textures.\n\n<img src=\"./images/Cellular_Degradation.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n<!--chapter:end:014-Tools-Audio_Generators.Rmd-->\n\n---\n---\n---\n\n# Tools - Creative use of audio effects\n\n\n\nIt ***is possible*** to create ambient tracks that do not use reverb and delay. But to be honest, it isn't done often. In the preface to this book I said about ambient music: \"Take any sound, drown it in reverb and delay... JOB DONE\". You can, and I'd argue you ***should*** do better than that. Creative use of audio effects can accentuate harmonics and do interesting things with those; provide some grit, noise or warble; take a rather plain sound and twist it until it forms something much more interesting and evolving. All this BEFORE drowning it in reverb and delay.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Key idea {.unnumbered}\n\nAudio effects and automation together can take sounds and keep them interesting and evolving in ways that go beyond \"static\" application of reverb and delay on Return channels. Think of how you can use the huge range of creative effects provided by Ableton and employ these in ways that will take your original sound in completely new directions. This will provide the listener with some additional \"ear candy\" to keep the sounds interesting.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## The tools of the trade\nAbleton Live Suite comes with a HUGE range of audio effects and if you add in Max for Live effects there are almost too many audio-manglers out there to list or talk about in this chapter. While there are a few third-party audio effect plugins that are worth a mention, and which I use a LOT in my productions, you can get a LONG way with just the stock Ableton Live Suite audio effects. The benefit of third party plugins is where they offer something that the Live effects cannot. I'll talk about some of these below. But let's start looking at a few key plugins which are likely to be useful for ambient music.\n\n## Hybrid Reverb\nThe Hybrid Reverb in Live 11 Suite is a really nice reverb. It has a Convolution Impulse Response (IR) section which allows you to dial up real-world reverb from a wide variety of spaces and an Algorithm section which applies reverb processing and colouration. You can blend between these or apply them in parallel and series. This in itself offers up a huge variety of sounds. But when you dig into the Convolution IR section you'll also find options for textural processing - this applies a textural Impulse Response (IR) to the sound, so instead of a straight reverb tail, you'll get some additional texture from the IR audio file. The other thing to point out is that there is an option to have User-defined IR. This means that you can find IR audio files for different spaces online at sites like Open Air https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk and use some additional IR files for some famous spaces, like Hamilton Mausoleum and York Minster. Obviously finding the right reverb sound for ambient music is kind of a key item. But you don't have to use just one. I like to use a long, lush reverb to help smear sound and create drones. I usually put this on a FX Return channel so I can route several tracks to it and save CPU. But you may also need a shorter reverb for other instruments to give them presence, in the way that a close mic to an instrument in one of these huge reverb spaces will capture more of the raw sound, while the gigantic reverb captures the instrument in the space itself.\n\n<img src=\"images/Hybrid_Reverb.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Valhalla Supermassive\nHere's a third-party effect I couldn't do without. Valhalla Supermassive is a free audio effect plugin from Valhalla DSP https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-supermassive/. It's a staple of ambient and drone producers because a) it's free and b) it has some MASSIVE reverb algorithms (duh!). Suffice to say it does exactly what it says on the tin - massive reverbs. But what Valhalla have done rather well is to combine algorithms and delay lines so that some of its algorithms behave more like delays, while some act more like reverbs. They also have algorithms that combine both - early delay turning into massive reverb. Some have short attack, some much longer. One of my personal favourites is the \"Benson Arizona\" preset which will turn ANYTHING into a massive drone. Combine this with PaulStretch (as discussed in Chapter 14 - Tools - PaulStretch) and you'll have instant drones.\n\nTo be honest, all of Valhalla DSP's plugins are excellent and reasonably priced. I particularly like the Shimmer device to add shimmer and pitch shift reverb to sounds. Their Delay plugin provides a wide variety of delay types, including tape delay (complete with wobble and drive) but also usefully a reverse delay (where the original audio is played backwards in the delay). I like the latter as the delayed line comes back transformed compared to the input. Again this adds some interest to the part.\n\n<img src=\"images/Valhalla_Supermassive.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n## Echo\nI tend to prefer Live Suite's Echo effect rather than delay. There is a wide range of sounds possible using it, and some built in modulations and tweaks to the sound which add character. Use of Echo as a send effect has a long legacy in dub music where the DJ or producer would send a burst of signal to the Echo and by tweaking the feedback and EQ would create long tails of echo. \n\nBeing a Lazy Producer, I prefer to let random processes tweak the LFO settings. I have built an audio effect rack with a trio of LFOs working on each other and then changing the feedback amount, lower and upper ranges of the EQ so that these wobble about randomly. While the timing of the Echo is fixed, we have other parameters that mean that the sound is constantly shifting in an unpredictable way. This will prevent the Echo effect from being too \"samey\" across the track and provide some interesting moments. It's a bit like having a pair of \"robot hands\" that tweak the Echo settings.\n\n\n<img src=\"images/LFO_Echo.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Distortion\nDistortion may seem like a weird choice for ambient music where much of the music produced is \"pristine\" and \"delicate\". But there is a whole sub-genre where gritty, distorted sounds are most definitely a thing. My favourite from Live 11 Suite is the Saturator plugin which provides a wide range of subtle distortion and drive. While the Pedal plugin provides raw Overdrive, Distortion and Fuzz, Saturator allows you to drive the signal and dial in more subtle drive and overtones.\n\n<img src=\"images/Saturator_Pedal.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nLive 12's Roar device takes these to the next level though and provides a comprehensive set of tools for applying anything from subtle warmth to the inputs to full-blown distortion. It has a wide range of routing options, including multi-band which allows you to dial in distortion for different frequency bands.\n\n<img src=\"images/Roar.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Resonators\nThe Resonator plugin takes an incoming signal and then resonates it by pitch-shifting additional resonators. You can dial-in the amount that the resonant frequencies are heard via gain adjustment, you can define the pitch of the resonator and whether the resonator is centred on a particular pitch. This can be useful to create drone noises and coupled with a long reverb like the Valhalla Supermassive you can create some really lush ambient beds.\n\nI have found that a little drive to the input signal (which boosts upper resonant frequencies of the audio) works will with resonator to make the result more pronounced.\n\n<img src=\"images/Resonator.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## Spectral processing\nAbleton Live Suite 11 includes three Spectral audio effects. Spectral processing is interesting because instead of applying effects in a time-based manner (as audio comes through the effect) it is applying effects according to frequency (low to high) and loudness.\n \n### Ableton Spectral effects\nSpectral Blur blurs the incoming audio between nominated frequency bands. Tweaking the Residual and Halo amounts will apply different amounts of blurring in the output.\n\nSpectral Time which can be either apply a freezing algorithm to catch and hold incoming audio, or delay which applies delay and frequency shifting. The Tilt, Spray and Mask parameters apply the delayed audio to different parts of the frequency spectrum and gives some interesting smeared, granular and glitchy sounds. The Freezer and Delay algorithms can be used separately or chained serially from one into the other. Setting long fade in and fade out times allows you to catch and smear incoming audio which may be useful as part of a performance to join between two tracks or two sections of a mix.\n\nSpectral Resonator is a resonator which focuses on different parts of the frequency spectrum, so you can tailor the resonance quite precisely. You can have a static tone for the resonance or pass in a MIDI part to change the resonance around a MIDI part. The different resonance algorithms - Chorus, Wander and Granular all have different sounds and it's worth playing with these to see which ones fit what you're trying to achieve.\n\n<img src=\"images/Spectral_Devices.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nRishabh Rajan has useful YouTube videos explaining the Spectral Time (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUZLXAK8do4) and Spectral Resonator (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAebi_brjEs) effects. \n\n### Michael Norris Soundmagic Spectral collection\nMichael Norris has created some fantastic spectral plugins which can be downloaded here: https://www.michaelnorris.info/software/soundmagic-spectral as donation-ware.\n\nThe Spectral Averaging and Spectral Blurring are my two favourites from this collection to smear and blur incoming audio and create lush drones with the same sonic \"fingerprint\" as the original, but as a long drone texture. Applying these to the an audio clip or to a PaulStretch stretched audio will apply even more smearing and blurring to create fantastic drone textures. \n\nThe key parameter in both of these plugins is the FFT size which determines the size of the sample window in which the blurring or averaging is taking place. Larger FFT sizes smear more, but take longer to fade in and out since the processing is happening over a larger window of audio. You may also find that you need to increase the gain of the output.\n\n<img src=\"images/Spectral_Averaging.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n<img src=\"images/Spectral_Blurring.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nThe whole collection is worth checking out for some very interesting effects, although as you can see above the user interface is VERY bare-bones.\n\n## Other notable mentions\n\n### Shifter\nShifter is a combination of a pitch and frequency shifter and ring modulator. It's a bit of a beast because it can be either subtle and also extremely weird depending on how much shifting you do (and what type). This video provides a nice overview of the different modes and features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdhGroVd1aI\n\n<img src=\"images/Shifter.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n### Corpus\nCorpus is the audio effect companion to the Collision instrument. The input audio is used to excite a resonator - a plate, tube, membrane etc. - which then resonates. Depending on the resonator you choose you get different artefacts and results. \n\n<img src=\"images/Corpus.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n## FX in series vs Effects Rack vs Return channels vs Separate tracks\nThere are so many routing options in Ableton Live that give us a HUGE range of possibilities when it comes to routing audio through effects. The effects can be on the track itself either in series (each effect passes its output on to the next effect) or in parallel using Effects Racks, on a separate track that brings audio from another track into it - with Monitor set to \"In\" and input selecting from another audio track or group bus - or in a Return channel where one or more tracks are routed into the Return send for processing. So which to choose?\n\nI don't mind. It's YOUR track. But here are some thoughts on how ***I*** would use each option.\n\nI would use effects in series where I want the effects to build on each other. This is helpful if you're going to use an effect to add some colour which can be exploited in the next effect, for example adding some grit that will ping a resonator, or a compressor to reduce the highs and bring up quieter moments which can then be fed into a saturator.\n\nEffects in an Effects Rack are typically in parallel, although it's of course possible to build chains of effects within each chain or layer of the Effects Rack. I typically use these and then apply some modulation that will fade in and out each chain or select between them so that over time the different effects are not static over time.\n\nReturn channels are really useful if you'd like to send more than one track to an effect (reverb or delay) where you'd like to keep the effect consistent for each track or where you want to \"mix\" various tracks through an effect.\n\nUsing the output of one track as the input for another and then applying effects is a little like using a Return channel only the return channel is an ordinary Live track. This can be useful if you want to keep the \"raw\" track in the mix *and* apply effects separately, but it also allows you to pass the result of ***that*** track on into another track. So at any stage you can split out the audio, apply effects, route any of that signal to Return channels, then ingest the effected track into a further track for yet more processing.\n\nSo the choice is yours. Really. Try them all out. See which one works for you in a given situation. I don't mean that you should ***pick one*** and stick with it, but rather that you have a range of possible avenues to explore even within one track.\n\n## Use an Envelope with your effect\nIf your sound has a sharp attack, you may want to soften the send to the FX so that only the tail of the sound gets effected. Use an Envelope Follower effect before the audio effect. By setting the Map to 100% lowest and 0% highest (inverting the signal) it will duck the initial part of the sound (turning the send DOWN) and then bring it back up as the audio decays. Not that in the device below I have turned up gain to accentuate the behaviour (basically to make the peak duck enough that the initial part of the audio has a low enough send amount) and I have smoothed out the Rise and Fall amounts which removes any \"pumping\" of the send to the Return channel effect. By setting a Delay you can also manually dial in how much or little of that initial part of the sound gets sent to the Return channel. This technique can be useful to capture and build drone sounds where you want to avoid sudden changes volume.\n\n<img src=\"images/Envelope_Follower_Send.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n<!--chapter:end:015-Tools-Audio_Effects.Rmd-->\n\n---\n---\n---\n\n# Tools - Extreme audio stretching with PaulStretch\n\n\n\nPaulXStretch (<https://sonosaurus.com/paulxstretch/>) is a plugin that takes an audio file and stretches it to produce soundscapes and textures. This is not the type of stretching that is available in Ableton for warping audio by a few bpm to fit a different tempo, but instead is about sonic manipulation even to extreme amounts.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Key idea {.unnumbered}\n\nTaking an audio clip that has interesting harmonic structure, chords, textures and stretching it out using PaulXStretch can give you instant ambient textures and drones. Even using short audio clips and stretching out 5x or 10x can give interesting textures to work from.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Why would you want to stretch audio?\n\nStretching here means \"smearing\" audio, creating a blurred texture. The recognisable features of the original clip are no longer distinguishable, and instead you get something like a \"ghost\" of the original. The chords and tones from the original are stretched to an extent that they turn into drones and glacially shifting harmonics. If that doesn't scream \"ambient\" then maybe you need to have a good look at the introductory definition of \"ambient\" again.\n\nBut seriously though - what this kind of stretching and smearing does is to give you a nice foundational element: a sound bed over which you can add other elements. Because the stretch smears out tones, it can sometimes add a slow movement of tonality rather than a sudden shift. This can be quite useful if you pick an audio source for stretching that works with the scale of the other processes in your track. It may for example allow you to imply a shift in tonality even if there's a repeating pattern (in a fixed scale) above it, much like how shifting bass notes below an ostinato line imply new harmonies.\n\n## What does it do?\n\nPaulXStretch takes an audio file and can stretch it to a pretty arbitrary amount (maximum is over 1000x). This allows you to take very short audio clips as input and stretch them out to create soundscapes of pretty much any size. So if you take the 5 second Windows Startup sound, you can stretch this 60x to create a five minute soundscape.\n\nSome audio stretching algorithms, such as those used by default in Ableton to stretch audio, introduce artefacts and granulations once the algorithm goes beyond a modest decrease in beats per minute (bpm). But PaulXStretch also applies some (spectral) smoothing to create textures that are free of glitches - the sound is smeared evenly in the sonic palette.\n\nThe plugin also features various options to tweak the output of the stretched audio, including filters, the ability enhance resonant frequencies, pitch shift and more.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nYou *can* use PaulXStretch as a plugin, but you can also use it as a standalone application. This would allow you to import, stretch, and then export the stretched file ready to import into your DAW as standalone audio. The latter is probably preferable in many cases - audition the file and stretching in the context of your tune, then commit and export to file.\n\n<img src=\"images/paulxstretch_screenshot.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n\n## What should I use it for?\n\nThis is a plugin that favours some experimentation. You could take a short, textural clip that you like and then stretch this out to see how the textures react to extreme stretching. Note that if the input clip features some prominent harmonics or frequencies, these will be accentuated when the audio is stretched, so you may want to EQ the input clip ***first*** before applying stretch to eliminate any howling frequencies. I have had some success using short clips with interesting chord patterns, and then stretching this out to create a long-form piece. Because chord changes are preserved, but smeared and smoothed, the track then shifts in tonality, rather than being a long drone on a single tone.\n\nNot all audio clips will sound good stretched. My best results in experimentation have come when there are no drums or unpitched high frequencies (cymbals or high percussion).\n\nAs an experiment I once took the grindcore metal band Napalm Death's (in)famous \"You Suffer\" track, all 1.316 seconds of it (Guiness World Record holder for the shortest song), and stretched it out to 1 minutes. The result was TERRIFYING. You can hear it here: <https://on.soundcloud.com/84gdq>\n\n\n\nA more sonically pleasing hyper stretch took the Windows 95 startup noise and stretched that out. <https://on.soundcloud.com/qurr7>\n\n\n\nAnother possibility is to use audio from other generative processes as the input to the stretching process. For example, try taking the results of the Follow Action \"Changing Chords\" recipe and using that as the input to the stretching process. Since the chords are designed to change incrementally using that recipe, it should work quite well as the input to this stretching, smearing out the chord changes even more and making them implicit rather than explicit. Taking something random, then stretching and smearing is a way to create something potentially more sonically interesting.\n\nI'm not guaranteeing that throwing any old nonsense through PaulXStretch will suddenly make it sound amazing, but it's sometimes worth a shot to see what the results will sound like. These can then be used as ambient \"beds\" or foundations for other sounds, textures and production on top.\n\n<!--chapter:end:016-Tools-PaulStretch.Rmd-->\n\n# Recipe - Making a drone using some audio generators and effects\n\n    \n\nIn this recipe we'll make a simple drone track using a variety of audio generators. \n\n1. Start by placing a Tree Tone audio generator on a track. I have chosen to ensure that the output is pitched and that it conforms to the C minor pentatonic scale. This will help integrate the sounds later.\n\n<img src=\"images/Recipe5_TreeTone.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n2. On another track, add a Harmonic Generator (from the Drone Lab pack). This is an instrument combining sine-wave drones oscillating at fixed pitches relative to the Root note. We can experiment later with this to see how changes to pitches or FM Ratio change the resulting sound, and maybe automate these via LFO, but for now, let's keep the drone from this to be quite static.\n\n<img src=\"images/Recipe5_HarmonicGenerator.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n3. Next let's add a real odd-ball: the Cellular Degradation plugin by Dillon Bastan. As described in Chapter 14, this is a weird instrument combining 5 different stereo FM oscillators, and it can make some VERY weird noises. That's what we're going to do here. Normally you \"draw\" into the main panel to make cells \"alive\" and then the cellular birth and death process retains these or allows them to \"die\". To automate that process we're using another favourite Dillon Bastan plugin, the Strange Mod modulation device. We can then use its chaotic modulation processes to automate \"drawing\" the X and Y values. This should produce some very strange buzzy textures.\n\n<img src=\"images/Recipe5_CellularDegradation.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n4. At this point I added a simple bass root note drone (on C1) using the Drift instrument. This helps anchor our drone.\n\nSince we want to balance the unexpected and predictable, here the bass drone note, and Harmonic Generator provide the \"anchor\" around which we can place Tree Tone (as a mildy chaotic process) and the Cellular Degradation as a VERY chaotic process.\n\n5. From here, feel free to add effects on Return channels (Reverb and Delay are good options) and / or apply resonant processing within the individual tracks - like adding the Resonator or Spectral Resonator plugins. Experiment. See what works. I found that putting a resonator on the Cellular Degradation track and tuning additional resonance pitches within the C minor pentatonic scale helped to \"tame\" the weirdness, if that's what you'd prefer. Another decent option (in addition or instead) might be to drive the Cellular Degradation track using a Saturator or distortion.\n\n<img src=\"images/Recipe5_CellularDegradation_Resonator.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n6. Sometimes, if using an audio generator it helps to add a compressor (occasionally a multiband compressor). This will reduce the peaks and can also bring up some of the quieter moments (if you increase the make up gain).

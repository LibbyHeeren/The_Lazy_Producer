# Process - Follow Actions

Ableton has had "Follow Actions" within Session View clips for a long time. Follow Actions allow you to perform a variety of actions at the end of a clip or after a given number of bars and beats. This allows you to sequence moving from one clip to another, playing the clip again, etc. There are a number of really useful uses for follow actions for live performance, but it also has incredible uses for making generative music. 

By default Live will perform the specified follow action every time. But there is a second option where the action is performed with a given probability, and with 1 minus that probability it will perform a different action. For example, it could do action 1 with 70% probability and action 2 with 30% probability. This means then that as a Lazy Producer you can set up Follow Actions that will automatically launch clips, choose what to play next, and using ONLY Follow Actions you can get rich sets of generative actions, particularly if you use similar techniques across tracks.

# Tools and plugins - The probability pack: Probability Arp

The probability pack by Sonic Faction (<https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/probability-pack/#?item_type=max_for_live>) is a great set of plugins for making generative music and creating tracks involving probability and randomness - probability of a note happening, probability of which pitch or sample is trigger, randomness on an arpeggiator pitch, style and sequence length and many other attributes. The pack consists of 5 Max for Live devices:

-   Probability Arp

-   Melodic Probability

-   Rhythmic Probability

-   Step Divider

-   Dr. Chaos

In the Recipe - Changing Chords, we've used the Probability Arp. This device allows you to specify a chord, shape and inversion (this part is optional), but the arpeggiator itself allows you to specify ranges of arpeggiator rates, styles, pattern length and octaves and then dial in the chance that these parameters will change via the "Amt" dials.

I've used the device on the Piano part, varying the pattern rate moderately, the arpeggiator style and sequence length and octave quite a lot - so that the arpeggiator style, sequence length and octave change frequently. This means that this part is constantly changing. In reality this may be too much and it's your choice as the Lazy Producer to tune these parameters to your taste. Of course, if you're a Really Lazy Producer, you can take my settings.

I have used other plugins from this pack - particularly the Dr. Chaos device which we'll revisit in a separate "Idea" for Tools.

Note that this pack was created BEFORE Live 11, at a time where note-wise probability was not implemented. At that time the ONLY way to have sequences with random note chance was via Max for Live devices and sequencers.

The Melodic Probability plugin features note-wise probability, but also an element of randomness in octave pitch. This means that it can sequence melody lines where certain notes may randomly change in pitch with each pass of the sequencer, which is a nice feature to add some additional surprise to a melodic line and prevent it from being the same each time through.

Rhythmic Probability does very similar things for rhythmic parts. To be honest, the built-in velocity range and note-wise probability within Live 11 clips may make this plugin obsolete.

Step Divider on the other hand is a plugin for creating complex polyrhythms, dividing individual beats into ratchet like effects and much more. If you're a Lazy Producer and can't face micro-edits on drum parts, then this device may help deliver what you're after. Definitely one for producers who like glitchy sounds.

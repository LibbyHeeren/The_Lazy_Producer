# Tools - MIDI tools: creating sequences

There are many tools within Ableton Live 11 and Max for Live that will generate (random) chords for you. In [Process - Note-wise probability] we looked at generating chords randomly by stacking MIDI notes in a clip, then applying probability to randomly select which notes to sound. This produced a chord that changed everytime the MIDI clip looped around.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key idea

Adding notes, changing the lengths of notes and generating chords within a given scale using MIDI plugin tools can form the basis of a generative piece. Using other MIDI plugins to arpeggiate these chords and add additional notes and harmonies will produce a constantly evolving sequence of MIDI notes within the scale.

## Max for Live Mt.Sev plugin

The [mt.Sev Max for Live plugin is by pATCHES](https://patches.zone/mtsev). It is based on [a 2011 Max patch by Katsuhiro Chiba](https://audiooo.com/max-patches). In it, you choose where the central pitch is going to be by dragging the mouse cursor over the left hand pane - the left-to-right X-axis defines the pitch. Dragging the cursor up and down along the Y-axis either makes the spread of notes wide (higher values towards the top of the box) or narrower (lower values towards the bottom of the box). Pitches to be used can be defined using the note scale, and the Chance knob defines the overall probability of notes sounding. The v.center and v.rdm settings define the base velocity and amount of random velocity around this. The settings "off, 1, 2, 4, 8" allows you to define how many bars to play before mt.Sev changes to the next sequence, defined via the dots below the scale. This allows you to set up various scales, note spreads, patterns etc. So this plugin is useful for creating note sequences

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

If you're looking for a guide to creating tracks from start to finish in a DAW then this is not that book.

If you're looking for a description of recording a band or producing genres outside of ambient music, this is not that book.

If you are looking for generic tips on creating music I wholeheartedly recommend reading "Making Music: 74 Creative Strategies for Electronic Music Producers" by Dennis DeSantis [@desantis2015making]. This is a great book and will help you get through difficulties starting, continuing and finishing your compositions.

I also recommend Loopop's "In-complete book of electronic music tips and tricks" available when you sign up as a Patron (<https://www.patreon.com/loopop>). His book contains an assortment of tips and tricks for making music including ideas for generative music.

But if you're looking for some ideas to get you started and make some nice ambient sounds that you could later build up into finished tracks, then this ***IS*** that book. What I'm going to try to present here is a collection of "starter ideas" or recipes for you to follow.

## Who am I?

My name is Mike K Smith. I trained as a statistician and work as a data scientist in the pharmaceutical industry. I identify as a professional geek.

I make ambient, textural and sometimes generative music mostly using Ableton Live. I have released 2 albums collaborating with other musicians - where they prepared starter audio "stems" of tracks which I then augmented and created finished tracks. I have also produced an album of drone and textural music under my own name.

I describe myself as a "Lazy Producer" because I sometimes see the Live sets of other producers and I'm amazed at the number of tracks, the precision edits, the layers of sound that have been built up and I think that my sets by contrast are sparse and use many tricks to avoid having to create, mix and edit layer upon layer of sound. As a Lazy Producer I also want to get ideas generated quickly, commit these to a track and move on.

## What will I need to be able to use the ideas in this book?

You will get most out of this book if you have Ableton Live 11 Suite. Some of the ideas could be translated to other DAWs, but there are some features like note-wise probability which I'm not sure how to replicate in other DAWs.

## Why Ableton?

I am a long time Ableton user (since Live 4). As I write this guide, I am using Live 11 and I am particularly enjoying the new probability features in Live and Max4Live devices. I have a strong belief that Ableton Suite can be used much like a modular synthesiser - with the combination of audio and MIDI routing within Live, coupled with Max4Live devices, this amazing DAW can do so much.
